//! Utility types to support cancellation.
//!
//! In a typical IDE use-case, requests and modification happen concurrently, as
//! in the following scenario:
//!
//!   * user types a character,
//!   * a syntax highlighting process is started
//!   * user types next character, while syntax highlighting *is still in
//!     progress*.
//!
//! In this situation, we want to react to modification as quckly as possible.
//! At the same time, in-progress results are not very interesting, because they
//! are invalidated by the edit anyway. So, we first cancel all in-flight
//! requests, and then apply modification knowing that it won't interfere with
//! any background processing (this bit is handled by salsa, see
//! `BaseDatabase::check_canceled` method).

/// An "error" signifing that the operation was canceled.
