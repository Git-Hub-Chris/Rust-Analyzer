/// Main entry point for completion. We run completion as a two-phase process.
///
/// First, we look at the position and collect a so-called `CompletionContext.
/// This is a somewhat messy process, because, during completion, syntax tree is
/// incomplete and can look really weird.
///
/// Once the context is collected, we run a series of completion routines which
/// look at the context and produce completion items. One subtelty about this
/// phase is that completion engine should not filter by the substring which is
/// already present, it should give all possible variants for the identifier at
/// the caret. In other words, for
///
/// ```no-run
/// fn f() {
///     let foo = 92;
///     let _ = bar<|>
/// }
/// ```
///
/// `foo` *should* be present among the completion variants. Filtering by
/// identifier prefix/fuzzy match should be done higher in the stack, together
/// with ordering of completions (currently this is done by the client).
